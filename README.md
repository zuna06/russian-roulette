##### Ariel listen to me
##### OO languages?
##### It's a mess
##### Programming in C
##### Is better than anything they got over there
##### The syntax might seem much sweeter
##### Where objects and subtypes play
##### But frills like inheritance 
##### Will only get in the way!
##### Admire C's simple lansdscape
##### Efficiently dangerous
##### No templates or fancy pitfalls
##### Like Java and C++
##### Program in C
##### Program in C
##### Pointers, assembly
##### Manage your memory
##### With malloc() and free()
##### Don't sink your app with runtime bloat
##### Software in C will stay afloat
##### Do what you want there
##### Close to the hardware!
##### Program in C!
